Because array A has an odd length both the min and max values are initialized as the first term in the array and set the starting index to be 1. Then the iteration through the array compares adjacent values in the array so the first round of iteration does comparison between 3 and 5 which is true for the arr[i] < arr[i + 1] case. Going into that if it then checks if 3 is less than the min_val which is true because min_val is set to 9 at the time. So the min_val is then set to 3. 5 is then compared to max_val which is also 9 at the time but that fails so max_val remains 9 for that iteration. The iterations continue until i reaches the array's length - 1 and then returns an object identifying the min and max values of the passed in array.\n",

You may need to modify the values of n if an algorithm runs too fast or too slow to collect the running time data.  If you program in C your algorithm will run faster than if you use python.   The goal of this exercise is to collect run time data.  You will have to adjust the values of n so that you get times greater than 0.\n",
