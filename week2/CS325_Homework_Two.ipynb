When the arrays passed in become single element those single elements will be returned as the \"majority\" of their single element arrays. The other levels will return elements as a result of the two recursive calls. The crux of the algorithm is that if there exists a majority element in the array then that element will be a majority element for either/both of the left or right sub-arrays. There are four possible outcomes from the algorithm:\n",

    "* This situation would be similar to the one directly above but it would be the case that the left side returned a majority and the right did not.\n",
    "* Both calls on the left and right sub-arrays return majority elements. So there needs to be a count of both elements in the combined array to determine if either one is in fact a majority element of the total array, if so then it would be returned, otherwise no element would be returned.\n",
