    "            STOOGESORT(A[0...k - 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Explain why the STOOGESORT algorithm sorts its input. (This is not a formal proof)\n",
    "\n",
    "For when $n = 2$ (base case) <code>STOOGESORT(A[0, 1])</code> while properly sort the array by swapping the two elements if the first element is greater than the second, otherwise the array will be unchanged because it is already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "However when the length of the array is greater than 2 e.g. ($n \\geq 3$) an integer k is calculated which is the ceiling of the $\\frac{2}{3}$ of length $n$. Then there are the three recursive calls to STOOGESORT where the passed in arrays for each call are as follows:\n",

    "* First subarray is the first $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total array which is then sorted in the first call\n",
    "* Second subarray is the last $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total array which is then sorted in the second call\n",
    "* The third recursive call sorts the first $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total array again like the first call before it.\n",

    "b) Would STOOGESORT still sort correctly if we replaced k = ceiling(2n/3) with m = floor(2n/3)? If yes prove, if no give a counterexample. (Hint: what happens when n = 4?)\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it would not still sort correctly. A good counter example would be if we passed the following array into STOOGESORT:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $[23, 12, 5, 67]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will step through the function with the given input to show that it would not sort correctly when using $m = floor(\\frac{2n}{3})$:\n",

    "* We now calculate the variable $m$ to be equal to $m = floor(\\frac{2 * 4}{3}) = 2$\n",
    "* The first recursive call of STOOGESORT will be passed in the sub-array of $[23, 12]$ which will satisfy the $n = 2$ condition which will swap the two elements so the total array is now: $[12, 23, 5, 67]$.\n",
    "* The second recursive call of STOOGESORT will be passed in the sub-array of $[5, 67]$ which will satisfy the $n = 2$ condition which will not do anything to the sub-array because $A[0] \\lt A[1]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "* $T(n) = a * T(\\frac{n}{b}) + f(n)$ Whereas $a = 3$ because of $3$ recursive calls and $b = \\frac{2}{3}$ because the input $n$ is sub-divided into $\\frac{2}{3}$ sub-problems therefore:\n",

    "* $n^{log_{\\frac{3}{2}}(3)} = n^{2.70} = \\Omega(f(n))$ Because $f(n) = c$ where $c$ is some constant\n",
